- Use factory functions and IIFEs for a revealing module pattern
- Program mindfully with SOLID principles for clean and scalable code
- Rely on array methods including map and reduce to handle objects

### Store and retrieve data with JSON
- Set and get JSON from localStorage using Web Storage API
- Write own stringify and parse methods to store information about nested objects
